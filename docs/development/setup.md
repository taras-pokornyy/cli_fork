# Development setup

This page outlines how to set up your development environment to build and develop with the DataRobot CLI.

> **GitHub CLI Recommendation**: DataRobot recommends using the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) for fork management. All examples use `gh` commands. See the [GitHub CLI installation guide](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation) if needed. If you prefer manual git workflow, you can replace `gh` commands with equivalent `git` operations.

## Prerequisites

- [Go 1.26.1](https://golang.org/dl/)
- Git for version control
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) (A task runner)

## Installation

### Install task

Task is required for running development tasks.

#### macOS

```bash
brew install go-task/tap/go-task
```

#### Linux

```bash
sh -c "$(curl --location https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)" -- -d -b /usr/local/bin
```

#### Windows

```powershell
choco install go-task
```

## Set up the development environment

### Clone the repository

```bash
# Fork and clone in one command
gh repo fork datarobot-oss/cli --clone --default-branch-only
cd cli
```

### Install development tools

```bash
task dev-init
```

This will install all necessary development tools including linters and code formatters.

### Build the CLI

```bash
task build
```

The binary will be available at `./dist/dr`.

### Verify the build

```bash
./dist/dr self version
```

## Available development tasks

To view all available tasks:

```bash
task --list
```

### Common tasks

| Task | Description |
| ------ | ------------- |
| `task build` | Build the CLI binary. |
| `task test` | Run all tests. |
| `task test-coverage` | Run tests with a coverage report. |
| `task lint` | Run linters and code formatters. |
| `task fmt` | Format code. |
| `task clean` | Cleanly build artifacts. |
| `task dev-init` | Set up a development environment. |
| `task install-tools` | Install development tools. |
| `task run` | Run the CLI without building (e.g., `task run -- templates list`). |

## Build the CLI

**Always use `task build` for building the CLI.** This ensures that:

- The version information from git is included
- The git commit hash is embedded
- The build timestamp is recorded
- The proper `ldflags` configuration is applied

```bash
# Standard build (recommended)
task build

# Run without building (for quick testing)
task run -- templates list
```

## Running tests

```bash
# Run all tests (both unit and integration)
task test

# Run tests with coverage
task test-coverage

# Run specific test
go test ./cmd/auth/...
```

## Linting and formatting

For linting and formatting, this project uses the following tools:

- `golangci-lint` for comprehensive linting
- `go fmt` for basic formatting
- `go vet` for suspicious constructs
- `goreleaser check` for release configuration validation

```bash
# Run all linters (includes formatting)
task lint

# Format code only
task fmt
```

### Updating golangci-lint

When upgrading the Go version in `go.mod`, update golangci-lint if needed:

```bash
# 1. Check available versions at https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/releases
# 2. Update GOLANGCI_LINT_VERSION in Taskfile.yaml
# 3. Reinstall the binary
task install-tools

# 4. Verify linting works
task lint
```

golangci-lint is installed as a pre-built binary, so version mismatches with your project's Go version are handled automatically.
