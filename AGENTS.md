## Project Overview

DataRobot CLI (`dr`) - A Go-based command-line interface for managing DataRobot custom applications with OAuth integration, template management, and task execution capabilities.

## Build & Development Commands

Use Taskfile tasks rather than raw Go commands:

| Command         | Description                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `task build`    | Build the CLI binary (outputs to ./dist/dr) |
| `task lint`     | Lint and format all code                    |
| `task test`     | Run tests with race detection and coverage  |
| `task dev-init` | Initialize development environment          |
| `task run`      | Run CLI directly via `go run`               |

## Testing

- Run tests: `task test`
- Tests use `testify/assert` for assertions
- Test files follow `*_test.go` naming convention
- If DR_API_TOKEN is set, run smoke tests: `task smoke-test` (but ask for permission before using a real API token)

**Go Version Requirement:** Tests run with the `-race` flag for data race detection. The race runtime must match your Go compiler version exactly. If you see errors like `compile: version "go1.X.Y" does not match go tool version "go1.X.Z"`, ensure your installed Go version matches the version in `go.mod` (run `brew upgrade go` or adjust `go.mod` accordingly).

## Code Style Requirements

### Go Whitespace Rules (Critical)

All code must pass `golangci-lint` with zero errors. Follow these whitespace rules:

1. **Never cuddle declarations** - Always add a blank line before `var`, `const`, `type` declarations when they follow other statements
2. **Separate statement types** - Add blank lines between different statement types (assign, if, for, return, etc.)
3. **Blank line after block start** - Add blank line after opening braces of functions/blocks when followed by declarations
4. **Blank line before multi-line statements** - Add blank line before if/for/switch statements

Example of correct spacing:

```go
func example() {
    x := 1

    if x > 0 {
        y := 2

        fmt.Println(y)
    }

    var result string

    result = "done"

    return result
}
```

### TUI Standards

- Always use `tui.Run()` to execute TUI models for global Ctrl-C handling and debug logging
- Always wrap new TUI models with the InterruptibleModel from the `tui` package to ensure global Ctrl-C handling
- Reuse existing TUI components from `tui` package or Bubbles library (https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles)
- Use styles from `tui/styles.go` for consistency
- When `--debug` is enabled, logs are written to `.dr-tui-debug.log`

## Quality Tools

All code must pass these tools without errors:

- `go mod tidy` - dependency management
- `go fmt` - basic formatting
- `go vet` - suspicious constructs
- `golangci-lint` - comprehensive linting (includes wsl, revive, staticcheck)
- `goreleaser check` - release configuration validation

**Before submitting code, mentally verify it follows wsl (whitespace) rules.**

### Updating golangci-lint

When upgrading the Go version in `go.mod`, you may need to update golangci-lint to ensure compatibility:

1. Check the [golangci-lint releases](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/releases) for a version that supports your target Go version
2. Update the `GOLANGCI_LINT_VERSION` variable in `Taskfile.yaml`
3. Run `task install-tools` to download the pre-built binary
4. Run `task lint` to verify compatibility

The `GOLANGCI_LINT_VERSION` is pinned to ensure reproducible builds across all development environments. The binary is installed as a standalone pre-built artifact, not via `go install`, so version mismatches between your project's Go version and golangci-lint's internal Go version are handled automatically.
