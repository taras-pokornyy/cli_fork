</details>

### Verify installation

You can verify the installation by checking the version:

```bash
dr --version
```

You should see output similar to:

```text
DataRobot CLI version: v0.2.37
```

### Updating the CLI

To update to the latest version of the DataRobot CLI, use the built-in update command:

```bash
dr self update
```

This command will automatically:

- Detect your installation method (Homebrew, manual installation, etc.)
- Download the latest version
- Install it using the appropriate method for your system
- Preserve your existing configuration and credentials

The update process supports:

- **Homebrew (macOS)**&mdash;automatically upgrades via `brew upgrade --cask dr-cli`
- **Windows**&mdash;runs the latest PowerShell installation script
- **macOS/Linux**&mdash;runs the latest shell installation script

After updating, verify the new version:

```bash
dr self version
```

## Quick start

Now that you have installed the DataRobot CLI, you can start using it to manage your DataRobot applications.
The following sections will walk you through configuring the CLI, setting up a template, and running tasks.

### Set up authentication

First, configure your DataRobot credentials by setting your DataRobot URL.
Refer to [DataRobot's API keys and tools page](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/platform/acct-settings/api-key-mgmt.html) for steps to locate your DataRobot URL, also known as your DataRobot API endpoint.

```bash
# Set your DataRobot URL (interactive)
dr auth set-url
```

<details><summary><em>Click here for more information about configuration files</em></summary>
<br/>
Configuration files are stored in:

- **Linux/macOS:** `~/.config/datarobot/drconfig.yaml`
- **Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%\.config\datarobot\drconfig.yaml`

See [Configuration files](docs/user-guide/configuration.md) for more details.
</details>

You'll be prompted to enter your DataRobot URL. You can use shortcuts for cloud instances:

- Enter `1` for `https://app.datarobot.com`
- Enter `2` for `https://app.eu.datarobot.com`
- Enter `3` for `https://app.jp.datarobot.com`
- Enter a valid URL if you have a custom/self-managed instance

Alternatively, set the URL directly:

```bash
dr auth set-url https://app.datarobot.com
```

Once you have configured the URL, log in to DataRobot using OAuth:

```bash
dr auth login
```

This will:

1. Open your default web browser
2. Redirect you to the DataRobot login page
3. Request authorization
4. Automatically save your credentials

Your API key will be securely stored in `~/.config/datarobot/drconfig.yaml`.

### Verify authentication

Check that you're logged in:

```bash
dr templates list
```

This command displays a list of available templates from your DataRobot instance.

> [!TIP]
> **What's next?** Now that you're authenticated, you can:
>
> - Browse available templates: `dr templates list`
> - Start the setup wizard: `dr templates setup`
> - See the [Command reference](docs/commands/) for all available commands

### Set up a template

Next, load the interactive setup wizard to clone and configure a template.
A **template** is a pre-configured application scaffold that you can customize.
When you clone and configure a template, it becomes your **application**&mdash;a customized instance ready to run and deploy.

```bash
dr templates setup
```

After a few moments, the setup wizard displays the application templates available.

> [!NOTE]
> You can navigate through the list of templates using the arrow keys, or filter by pressing the `/` key and entering a search term. The setup wizard will only display templates that are available to you.

Select a template by pressing the `Enter` key.
At the subsequent prompt, specify the desired directory name for the template and press `Enter` to have the setup wizard clone the template repository to your local machine.

<details><summary><em>Click here for manual setup instructions</em></summary>
<br/>

**Manual setup:** If you prefer manual control:

```bash
# 1. List available templates.
dr templates list

# 2. Set up a template (this clones and configures it).
dr templates setup

# 3. Navigate to the template directory.
cd TEMPLATE_NAME

# 4. Configure environment variables (if not done during setup).
dr dotenv setup
```

> [!TIP]
> **What's next?** After configuring your template:
>
> - Start your application: `dr start` or `dr run dev`
> - Explore available tasks: `dr task list`
> - See [Run tasks](#run-tasks) below
>
</details>

Follow the instructions when prompted to continue configuring the template.
The prompts vary depending on which template you selected.
When all steps are finished, press `Enter` to exit the wizard and proceed to the next section.

> [!NOTE]
> The CLI automatically tracks setup completion in a state file located at `.datarobot/cli/state.yaml` within your template directory. This allows the CLI to skip redundant setup steps on subsequent runs. For more details, see [State tracking](docs/user-guide/configuration.md#state-tracking).

> [!TIP]
> **What's next?** After the setup wizard completes, navigate to your new application directory with `cd [template-name]` and start your application with `dr start` or `dr run dev`.

### Run tasks

Now that you've cloned and configured a template, you can start running tasks defined in the template Taskfile.

**Quick start (recommended):**

Use the `start` command for automated initialization:

```bash
dr start
```

This command will:

- Verify your CLI version meets the template's minimum requirements (and prompt to update if needed).
- Check template prerequisites (required tools such as Task, Git).
- Check if you're in a DataRobot repository (if not, launches the template setup wizard, then runs `dr start` again in the cloned directory).
- Find and run a start command: `task start` from the Taskfile if available (runs immediately), or a quickstart script from `.datarobot/cli/bin/` if available (prompts to run unless you use `--yes`). If you're in a repository but neither exists, it shows a message and exits.

> [!TIP]
> You can use the `--yes` flag to skip all prompts and execute immediately. This is useful in scripts or CI/CD pipelines.

**Running specific tasks:**

For more control, execute individual tasks with the `run` command:

```bash
# List available tasks
dr task list

# Run the development server
dr run dev

# Or execute specific tasks
dr run build
dr run test
```

> [!TIP]
> **What's next?** Your application is now running! Explore the [Template system](docs/template-system/) documentation, set up [shell completions](docs/user-guide/shell-completions.md), or review the [Command reference](docs/commands/) for detailed command documentation.

## Common issues

### "dr: command not found"

**Why it happens:** The CLI binary isn't in your system's PATH, so your shell can't find it.

**How to fix:**

```bash
# Check if dr is in PATH
which dr

# If not found, verify the binary location
ls -l /usr/local/bin/dr

# Add it to your PATH (for current session)
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"

# For permanent fix, add to your shell config file:
# Bash: echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
# Zsh:  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

**How to prevent:** Re-run the installation script or ensure the binary is installed to a directory in your PATH.

### "Failed to read config file"

**Why it happens:** The configuration file doesn't exist yet or is in an unexpected location. This typically occurs on first use before authentication.

**How to fix:**

```bash
# Set your DataRobot URL (creates config file if missing)
dr auth set-url https://app.datarobot.com

# Authenticate (saves credentials to config file)
dr auth login
```

**How to prevent:** Run `dr auth set-url` and `dr auth login` as part of your initial setup. The config file is automatically created at `~/.config/datarobot/drconfig.yaml`.

### "Authentication failed"

**Why it happens:** Your API token may have expired, been revoked, or the DataRobot URL may have changed. This can also occur if the config file is corrupted.

**How to fix:**

```bash
# Clear existing credentials
dr auth logout

# Re-authenticate
dr auth login

# If issues persist, verify your DataRobot URL
dr auth set-url https://app.datarobot.com  # or your instance URL
dr auth login
```

**How to prevent:** Regularly update the CLI (`dr self update`) and re-authenticate if you change DataRobot instances or if your organization rotates API keys.

## Getting help

For additional help:

```bash
# General help
dr --help

# Command-specific help
dr auth --help
dr templates --help
dr run --help

# Enable verbose output for debugging
dr --verbose templates list

# Enable debug output for detailed information
